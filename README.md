# Optimus-BioETongue
Bio e-Tongue for Optimus: Grok-enhanced enzyme-based sensors for taste/biomarker analysis. Open-source, philanthropy-driven.

# Optimus-BioETongue

**Bio e-Tongue for Optimus**: Grok-powered, bio-inspired sensor for liquid analysis—mimicking human taste with enzyme-based arrays for 97%+ accuracy in flavor/biomarker detection. Evolves to e-Mouth for ingredient breakdown. Integrated with X OS; GKT rewards for testers/philanthropy (e.g., nutrition equity in India/global). Led by Anu—sustainable, open-source for circular economy.

## Vision
- **Health/Food**: Detect diseases (saliva biomarkers), analyze ingredients (e.g., honey purity).
- **Philanthropy**: Burn GKT for eco-funds (e.g., clean water analysis).
- **xAI Tie-In**: Grok-4 API for real-time pattern recognition; Optimus integration.

## Features
- Enzyme-simulated sensors (Python mock).
- AI analysis (PCA/neural net placeholders).
- GKT rewards (ERC-20 hooks).

## Setup
1. `pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn` (or use code_execution env).
2. Run `python simulate_etongue.py` for demo.
3. Deploy sensors: Integrate with Bosch BME688-like hardware.
